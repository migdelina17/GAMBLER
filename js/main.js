// Pseudocode

// Pseudocode outlines the app's logic using plain language. 
// It provides a road map to writing the code itself.




// STATE/DATA 
// We will be writing the program's state to set up the basics of out game
// // What does the application need to "remember" throughout its execution?

function inIt (){
    we need to remember the scores of the player and the computer

    we need to have a balance 

balance = {
    player: 0  //we need to be able to update this balance in two ways 
    //by adding funds, by withdrawing, and by wins (if we match a line of 3 or five)
}




winner = null; 
//the winner is null
//if computer wins we keep the funds, if player wins we add to b



}







//RENDER
// we will be using the render function to update the data as the player bets

// we need it to update 
// player's balance : 
// if wins or loses 

//  we will start with $5 bets! if you think you can handle a bigger challenge, 
//  we can add different betting ammounts for different winning options




// THE DOM (DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL)
// the dom will allow us to update the HTML visually as we play the game
// we will do so using CSS
